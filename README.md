## 📝 Naming Convention
- **Base solution**: `problemname.java`
- **Optimized solution**: `problemnameO.java` (O suffix indicates optimized)
- **Alternative approach**: `problemname2.java`

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Each file is self-contained and runnable
2. Run any solution:
   ```bash
   javac filename.java && java ClassName
3. Check comments for complexity analysis and approach explanation
4. Test cases cover edge cases and typical scenarios
